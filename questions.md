## What questions might we answer with this data?

# Do field goals matter, except as a tiebreaker for touchdowns? 

In what fraction of games does the winner have more touchdowns than the loser?

In what fraction of games does the winner have more field goals than the loser? 

While keeping field goals (etc) constant, adjust the value of touchdowns from 1 to infinity. In what fraction of games does the outcome change for each value? 

In games where field goals matter (that is, in games where the winner was not determined by touchdowns alone), what is different? Do these games tend to be won by the away team? Feature fewer plays? Etc. 

# As a function of field position and yards to go, when does it make sense to go for it on 4th? 

As a function of field position, get the average and standard deviation of yards advanced. Check that these are appropriate -- do we see bell curves? 

From 4th down at a given field position, then, run monte carlo games to gauge how often a touchdown is expected from that position. 

Compare this to the rate of success for a field goal as a function of field position.
